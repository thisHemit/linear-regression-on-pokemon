# Linear-regression-on-pokemon
Applying Linear Regression to find the relation between the HP and Total status of a Pokemon.

Note : Total status means the overall awesomeness of a pokemon.

The Data which is used for this project can be found at https://goo.gl/y6kKs3. This model uses 721 pokemon excluding the seventh generation pokemon to plot a linear graph to show the dependence.

So what can this be used for?

If this model knows the HP of a pokemon it has no info about it can predict its Total status (a close approximation).


To run this model on your computer, 

1. Install python 3.5+ from the official website https://goo.gl/qJKCY1.
2. Install pip3.
3. Install numpy, pandas and matplotlib libraries using the pip command.(see below for commands)
4. Download this zip file and unzip it in a suitable loacation.
5. Place the pokemon_alopez247.csv in the unzipped folder.
6. Run the python script (ie run linearRegression.py).
7. Enjoy the graph!

commands:
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install pandas
