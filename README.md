# linear-regression-on-pokemon
Applying Linear Regression to find the relation between the HP and Total status of a Pokemon.

Note : Total status means the overall awesomeness of a pokemon.

The Data which is used for this project can be found at www.kaggle.com/alopez247/pokemon. This model uses 721 pokemon excluding the seventh generation pokemon to plot a linear graph to show the dependence.

So what can this be used for?
If this model knows the HP of a pokemon it has no info about it can predict its Total status (a close approximation).
